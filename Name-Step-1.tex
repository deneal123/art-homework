\begin{abstract}
We introduce Graph Neural Diffusion (GRAND), which formulates graph learning as a continuous diffusion process, where Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are interpreted as the discretization of an underlying PDE. The model's layer structure and topology are directly related to the choices of temporal and spatial operators in the diffusion equation. Our approach tackles common challenges in graph learning, such as depth limitations, oversmoothing, and bottlenecks. By employing both linear and nonlinear diffusion schemes, GRAND ensures stability with respect to data perturbations through implicit and explicit discretization techniques. We demonstrate competitive results on standard graph benchmarks, showcasing the effectiveness of GRAND in addressing critical issues in graph learning.

\section{Introduction}
I selected this paper~\cite{pmlr-v139-chamberlain21a} because it presents a novel approach to graph learning by framing GNNs as discretizations of a continuous diffusion process, providing a mathematically principled foundation for deeper graph models. The method addresses critical challenges like oversmoothing and bottlenecks, which are common limitations in existing GNN architectures, while introducing more robust and efficient techniques through implicit and explicit schemes. Its competitive performance across benchmarks shows strong potential for advancing both theoretical and practical applications in graph-based machine learning.
